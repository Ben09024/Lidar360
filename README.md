The project is a low-cost, fast 360° 2D LiDAR scanner based on an ESP32. A TF-Luna LiDAR measures distances, while a NEMA17 stepper motor via a TMC2209 rotates the sensor evenly at 50–80 RPM. The goal of the project is to create a precise, flexible, and expandable 2D scanning platform that is compatible with open-source tools and serves as a basis for robotics, mapping, or research applications.
